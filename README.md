# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

Using Express I was able to complete the bulk of the application. The exception is the save function, which I will be going back to complete in the future. 

I ran into a few issues, some of them self-induced such as accidentally including several servers in my server.js file. This project did help me better understand the routes file structure and how to interact with the rest of the application.
